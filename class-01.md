### **Structure**



>In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to
structure documents



### **summary**

+ HTML pages are text documents.

 + HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.

+ Tags are often referred to as elements.

+ Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

+ Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.

+ Attributes require a name and a value.
+ To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.




### **Extra Markup**


Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML.
Each new version was designed
to be an improvement on the
last (with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed).
HTML 4
Released 1997
XHTML 1.0
Released 2000
HTML5
Released 2000

#### DOCTYPEs
Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
***DOCTYPE*** declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using

#### Comments in HTML
If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:
***(<! --comment goes here-->)*** 

#### ID Attribute

Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
