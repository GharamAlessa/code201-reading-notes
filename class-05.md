## Images
> There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart

### Three Rules for Creating Images
> There are three rules to remember when you
are creating images for your website which are
summarized below. We go into greater detail
on each topic over the next nine pages

1.Save images in
the right format
2. Save images at
the right size
3. Use the correct
resolution

#### Tools to Edit & Save Images
> There are several tools you can use to edit and
save images to ensure that they are the right
size, format, and resolution.



+  The <img> element is used to add images to a
web page.
+ You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
+ You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
+ Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.




## Color
> Color can really bring your pages to life.

+ Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
+ There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
+ Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
+ It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
+ CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
+ CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


## Text
> The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text

+ There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
+ There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
+ If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
+ You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
+ You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
