> Project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked.

> Researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google:
How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies?
Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy?
They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals.
They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.
 
> After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year,
 Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.
 
> Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important,
 except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group.
 
> As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared.
 First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion.
 
 >Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget
  that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations 
 and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.
