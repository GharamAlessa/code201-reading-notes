## Text
> When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.
 

### Semantic Markup
***(< strong >,< em > ,< blockquote >,< q > ....)***
 
 There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages â€” they are known as semantic markup.
 
 + HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

+ They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

### Introducing CSS
> CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
 
+ CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
+ Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
+ Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
+ Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
+ CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Basic Javascript Instructions


> A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

#### WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 

A script w ill have to temporarily st ore the bits of info rmation it needs to do its j ob. It can store t his data in variables. 
A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in  a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 

#### OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

+ A  script is made up of a series of statements.
+ Each statement is like a step in a recipe. 
+ Scripts contain very precise instructions.
+ For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
+ Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in  the script.
+ Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 
+ JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
+ Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.



#### Decisions and Loops
> Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself.
+ Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
+ Comparison operators (===, ! ==,  ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
+ Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
+ if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
