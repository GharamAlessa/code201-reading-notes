## Object Literals
#### WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
> Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, 
> variables and functions take on new names.
## Document Object Model
> The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of
 a web page while it is  in the browser window. 
 ### THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE
 > As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of t hat page. The model is called a DOM t ree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
  It consists of four main types of nodes.

1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with
2.  Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
##### ACCESS & UPDATE TEXT & MARKUP WITH INNERHTML Using the i nnerHTML
