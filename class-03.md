#  HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
### Lists
> There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:

● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
(< ol >,< li >)
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
(< ul >,< li >)

● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms
(< dl >,< dt >,< dd >)

### Boxes
> You can set several properties that affect the appearance of
these boxes.

+ CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
+ You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
+ You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
+ It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
+ Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
+ Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
+ CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.


### Basic JavaScript Instructions

##### ARRAYS
> An array is  a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

##### VALUES IN ARRAYS
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 


#### If... else statements
> The If... else statements checks a condition
> if its *true* the first code block executed
> if *false* then second code block executed

##### SWITCH STATEMENTS
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. 
Each *case* indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 


##### TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
> Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and this has some interesting side effects. 

##### CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE
> Because the presence of an object or array can be considered truthy, it is often used to check for t he existence of an element within a page.
