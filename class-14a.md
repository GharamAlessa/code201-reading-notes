# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

> The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.
 Each of these come with their own individual properties and values
 
 ### 2D Transforms   (two-dimensional-transforms)
 
 > Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes

##### transform elements:
+ 2D Rotate :The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
+ 2D Scale :Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
+ 2D Translate :The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning
, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
+ 2D Skew :The last transform value in the group, skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. 

### Combining Transforms
> It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example.

### Transform Origin

> To change this default origin position the transform-origin property may be used.

## Transitions
> As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.
The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
